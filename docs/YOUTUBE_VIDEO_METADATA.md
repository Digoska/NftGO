## Title

NFT-GO: Pokémon GO Meets NFTs | Location-Based NFT Collection | Hackathon Project

## Description

What if you could collect NFTs just by walking around your city? We built NFT-GO - basically Pokémon GO but for NFTs. Walk to real locations, discover 3D NFTs, trade them, and compete on leaderboards.

What it does:
- NFTs spawn at real GPS locations - you have to walk there to collect them
- Collect 3D animated models, images, and videos
- Built-in marketplace to buy and sell NFTs
- Level up, earn XP, build streaks, compete on leaderboards
- Rarity system (Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary)
- Some NFTs give you gameplay boosts
- VIP program with token vesting rewards

How it works:
1. Open the app and see NFTs on the map near you
2. Walk to those locations to collect them
3. Build your collection and trade with others
4. Level up and compete globally

Built with React Native + Expo (iOS & Android), TypeScript, Supabase (database, auth, storage), React Native Maps, Three.js for 3D models, and blockchain integration.

Built for [Hackathon Name] - showing how location tech and blockchain can work together to make NFTs actually fun and social.

Works on iOS and Android.
