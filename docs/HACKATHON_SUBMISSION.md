### What Makes Your Project Interesting/Different (1000 characters or less)

**Option 1:**
```
NFT-GO is basically Pokémon GO but for NFTs. Instead of just buying NFTs online, you actually have to walk around your city to find and collect them. We use GPS to spawn NFTs at real locations, so you need to physically go there to collect them.

What makes it different:
- Real-world GPS integration - NFTs spawn at actual locations, not just random spots
- Full 3D NFT support with animations, not just static images
- Built-in trading marketplace so you can buy/sell without leaving the app
- Gamification with XP, levels, streaks, and global leaderboards
- Some NFTs give you gameplay boosts when you hold them
- VIP program where you can lock tokens to get exclusive rewards

We built it with React Native and Expo so it works on both iOS and Android. Backend is Supabase for the database, auth, and file storage. The 3D models use Three.js for rendering.

The cool part is it makes NFTs actually fun and social. You're walking around, meeting people at spawn locations, competing on leaderboards. It's not just another NFT marketplace - it's a game.
```

**Option 2:**
```
We wanted to make NFTs more engaging than just buying and selling. So we built NFT-GO - a location-based collection game where you discover NFTs by actually exploring your city.

The main thing that sets it apart is the real-world integration. NFTs spawn at GPS coordinates, so you have to physically visit locations to collect them. This creates actual gameplay instead of just trading.

Features:
- GPS-based spawning system
- 3D animated NFT models (not just images)
- Peer-to-peer trading marketplace
- Leveling system with XP and daily streaks
- Global leaderboards
- Utility NFTs that boost your gameplay
- Token vesting VIP program

Tech stack is React Native + Expo for mobile, Supabase for backend, and Three.js for 3D rendering. Everything is real-time and works cross-platform.

It's like combining the exploration of Pokémon GO with the ownership of NFTs, plus trading and gamification. Makes blockchain tech accessible to people who might never use a traditional NFT platform.
```

**Option 3:**
```
NFT-GO combines location-based gaming with blockchain to create something new. You collect NFTs by walking to real-world locations, then trade them, level up, and compete with other collectors.

What's different:
1. Real GPS integration - NFTs spawn at actual locations, requiring physical movement
2. Full 3D support - animated models, videos, images, all viewable in-app
3. Complete ecosystem - collection, trading, gamification, and VIP rewards all in one app
4. Modern stack - React Native + Expo for cross-platform, Supabase for scalable backend
5. Mainstream appeal - gamification makes blockchain accessible to regular users

Built for [Hackathon Name] to show how location tech and blockchain can work together. The result is an engaging way to collect NFTs that encourages physical activity and social interaction.
