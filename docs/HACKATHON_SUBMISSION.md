## Description (250 chars)

Location-based NFT collection platform. Walk around your city to discover and collect 3D NFTs at real locations. Trade on marketplace, level up, compete on leaderboards.

## What Makes It Different (1000 chars)

NFT-GO is like Pokémon GO but for NFTs. You actually have to walk to real locations to collect them, not just buy them online.

We use GPS to spawn NFTs at actual places, so you need to physically go there. This makes it a game, not just another marketplace.

It has full 3D NFT support with animations, not just static images. There's a built-in trading marketplace so you can buy and sell without leaving the app. Plus gamification with XP, levels, streaks, and global leaderboards.

Some NFTs give you gameplay boosts when you hold them. There's also a VIP program where you can lock tokens to get exclusive rewards.

Built with React Native and Expo so it works on iOS and Android. Backend is Supabase for the database, auth, and file storage. 3D models use Three.js.

The cool thing is it makes NFTs fun and social. You're walking around, meeting people at spawn locations, competing on leaderboards. It's a game, not just trading.
